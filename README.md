# coding-practice-problems
A repo of practice problems for solving algorithm, OOP, and SQL questions

I try to always right test cases and sometimes I will even write a tester class if I feel up for it.  

algo problems will likely be done with mostly Python and maybe Javascript. OOP will be done in Python.
